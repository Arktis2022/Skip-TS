Check the paper in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10540605


Usage:
    Run main.py to train and test the Skip_ST model.

Introduction of the code:
    1. dataset.py for loading the training and testing dataset.
    2. encoder.py for the encoder of the model which is pretrained
    3. decoder.py which is the opposite of the structure of the encoder
    4. loss_function.py as Figure 2(b) showed in the paper
    5. eval_func.py for some useful functions
    6. main.py for training and testing the model
